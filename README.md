This is a crime scene. Players will play Sherlock Holmes, talk to suspects and find out the murderer.

The rule is simple: Only the murderer is lying. So finding the person who was lying also caught the murderer.

There were a total of five NPCs present, namely the policeman, the housekeeper, the wife and daughter of the dead man, and the bastard (the child of the dead man and his mistress).

Gather clues by talking to each character, then apprehend the killer!
